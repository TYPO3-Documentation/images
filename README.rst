Icons for Images Used in TYPO3 Documentation
============================================

Sample shapes that can be used in images in TYPO3 documentation, specifically for
creating images out of screenshots combined with boxes, arrows, numbers etc.


Goals of Project
================

* make it easier for contributors to use already existing icons
* give the images in the official TYPO3 documentation a consistent look
* make sure images conform to `TYPO3 style guide

Example:


Downloads
=========

Zipfile: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TYPO3-Documentation/images/master/final/archive/typo3-documentation-icons-1.0.0.zip

Preview Shapes
==============

This is a preview. This should render nicely on GitHub.

`preview <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/images/blob/master/final/icons_preview/Images.rst>`__

Do not use the icons in "icons_preview" in your images, use the icons in "icons".

Documentation
=============

* `Guidelines for Images <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/HowToDocument/GeneralConventions/GuidelinesForImages.html>`__
* TYPO3 Online Style Guide: https://typo3.org/project/brand/style-guide/


Overview of Versions
====================

Preferably, only the variants in "final" should be used in the documentation.

This is still a work in progress! So you may find, that there are
currently no images in "final" or they might change in the future.

* **final**: this is to be the final version
* **work-in-progress+drafts** : proposals and draft versions

  * 01-primary_orange_grey: Proposal (Sybille)
  * 02-design-team: Proposal by Design Team
  * 03-combination: Combination of proposal by design team with some additions (Sybille)
